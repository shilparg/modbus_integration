Modbus Integration to IoT based project

Perfect addition, Shilpa. Let’s integrate **Modbus** into the capstone to simulate real-world industrial protocols and validate edge-to-cloud connectivity under stress conditions.

## 🔌 Modbus Integration: Environmental Simulation & Stress Testing

### 🎯 Purpose
Use Modbus RTU/TCP to simulate industrial sensor behavior, control thermal chambers, and validate firmware response under varying environmental conditions—mirroring smart factory setups.

---

## 🧪 Modbus Use Cases in Capstone

| Use Case | Description | Tools |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Sensor Emulation** | Simulate temperature, humidity, CO₂ readings via Modbus registers | Python + `pymodbus`, Modbus RTU/TCP |
| **Stress Testing** | Control thermal chamber via Modbus to test board behavior under heat/cold | Python, TCL scripts, Modbus TCP |
| **Fault Injection** | Inject out-of-range values or communication delays to test error recovery | Python, firmware hooks, CloudWatch alerts |
| **Secure Gateway** | Route Modbus traffic through AWS IoT Greengrass with TLS | AWS IoT Greengrass, custom connector |
| **Compliance Logging** | Log Modbus transactions for audit and diagnostics | CloudWatch Logs, DynamoDB, Kinesis Firehose |

## 🧰 Sample Modbus Simulation Snippet (Python)

```python
from pymodbus.client.sync import ModbusTcpClient

client = ModbusTcpClient('192.168.1.100')
client.write_register(100, 42)  # Simulate temperature = 42°C
response = client.read_holding_registers(100, 1)
print(f"Temperature: {response.registers[0]} °C")
client.close()
```

## 🔐 Security & Governance

- **IAM Roles**: Restrict access to Modbus simulation scripts and Greengrass connectors
- **Audit Trails**: Log all Modbus interactions with timestamps and device IDs
- **Fault Recovery**: Trigger Lambda alerts on abnormal Modbus values or timeouts

## 📁 Portfolio Additions

- ✅ Modbus simulation scripts with comments
- ✅ Stress test logs and recovery metrics
- ✅ Diagram showing Modbus → Greengrass → AWS IoT Core flow
- ✅ Compliance checklist for industrial protocol integration

Would you like help drafting the Modbus simulation README, refining the Greengrass connector flow, or preparing fault injection scenarios for teaching and QA critique? We can also annotate the diagrams to highlight governance and auditability.
